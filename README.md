# Bike sharing in Helsinki
The purpose of the project is to analyze bike and scooter sharing systems in Helsinki (Autumn 2019).
It aims to:

1. Predict bike availibility using among other features scooter density
2. Spot problematic bike stations which are clearly under- or overutilized

The latter is mostly discovered with interactive data visualization
